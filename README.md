# Bakeoff One

Carnegie Mellon University's Designing Human Centered Software's S1 Bakeoff One is an open-ended design challenge to develop rapid prototyping skills.

The project consists of a Processing application. This program tests the user's ability to click one of sixteen boxes, laid out in a 4x4 grid, as accurately and as quickly as possible. The goal is to modify the code to minimize the time between clicks while maximising accuracy. Time is the important metric, but a time penalty is added to accuracies below 95%.

Any modifications made cannot violate the following rule: Every button must be equally clickable at any instant.
